# IV4-Project
To run this project make sure you have Matlab R2022b installed.

1: Open the file "Alle_konstanter_24_5_kl_20.m".
2: Load the files "idensdata.mat", "nyeretabelTcp.mat", and "park_power.mat" to your workspace 
4: Run "Alle_konstanter_24_5_kl_20.m"
3: Open the file "Hele_modellen_24_05_kl_20.slx", and run the program at will. 

It might be necessary to install some additional packages to Simulink if the model is not working.

Results can be viewed on various scopes, and in the simulation data inspector.

Running the simulation for any longer than 18999 seconds will not yield valid results.
